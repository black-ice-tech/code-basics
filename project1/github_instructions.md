# Getting setup with GitHub
If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, do some research before diving in here and try to understand the basic concepts of it's purpose. Don't worry about understanding the details, just try to get a grasp on what it's used for and why it's useful.

**These instructions are intended for you and your instructor to walk through together**. Prior to going through these steps, install GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/

## Steps
- Your instructor should have already created a repository for you, go ahead and clone it.
- Open up the solution in Visual Studio
- Run the program (should be a simple "Hello World!" program)
- Create a branch, then change something small in your program and do a commit
- Push your branch to your repository
- Create a "pull request", commonly referred to simply as a "PR"
- Once it's merged, switch branches to "master" and pull the code
