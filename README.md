# Course Overview
## Summary
This course is intended to be a starting point. Right now, you want to be a programmer, but you don't know where to start. You need someone to teach you. The goal is, at the end of this course, to have enough knowledge / skills to continue your learning on your own. But don't expect to get out of this class and get a job right away. View this as a booster for your own self-learning journey.

## Phase 1 - Learning the basics
This is going to be learning the basics of programming, learning to get comfortable with the tools. Each week will have different homeworks, and you'll submit the homeworks to the Git repository.

## Phase 2 - The project
This is where you begin to start working on a project that builds on itself each week. You'll take the skills you learn from phase #1 and attempt to translate it to a project.

## Homework
Homework input and output must be exactly what is described in the requirements. Your instructor will keep asking you to fix your program until it does. **Why is this important?** 
TODO: more on this...
In the workplace, you will eventually come to a point where coding is relatively easy. The most challenging part is determining *what* to build. You and your team can build the most kick-ass social network in the world, but if it's not what your clients or users want, it's completely useless. If you don't ask questions, and spend lots of time determining the right thing to build, you're running the risk of building something useless. For most of this course, the requirements given will be very explicit, because the purpose is to learn code. However, since you do have explicit requirements, it's important to follow them to the letter, because this doesn't give your client (your instructor) any reason to fault you.
