# Course Overview
## Summary
This course is intended to be a starting point. Right now, you want to be a programmer, but you don't know where to start. You need someone to teach you. The goal is, at the end of this course, to have enough knowledge / skills to continue your learning on your own. But don't expect to get out of this class and get a job right away. View this as a booster for your own self-learning journey.

## Phase 1 - Learning the basics
This is going to be learning the basics of programming, learning to get comfortable with the tools. Each week will have different homeworks, and you'll submit the homeworks to the Git repository.

## Phase 2 - The project
This is where you begin to start working on a project that builds on itself each week. You'll take the skills you learn from phase #1 and attempt to translate it to a project.
