# Course Overview
## Summary
This course is intended to be a starting point. Right now, you want to be a programmer, but you don't know where to start. You need someone to teach you. The goal is, at the end of this course, to have enough knowledge / skills to continue your learning on your own. But don't expect to finish this course and get a job right away. View this as a booster for your own self-learning journey. 

Learning software is hard! You will get very frustrated at times, and other times you will feel like you can do anything. Embrace both of these, as they are both part of the process. Software requires a certain mindset adjustment that feels unnatural at first, just like learning a new spoken language. Learning software is also very incremental. 

## Philosphy
Completing this course has zero value. That's right. You don't get a medal, you won't automatically get a 5% salary increase at your current job. There is no certificate or degree. The value comes from learning the foundations of programming, and going through this course will (if we do our jobs right) help you learn exactly that. **The last thing we want is for you to value finishing this course over actually learning the material.** Let me repeat that. The last thing we want is for you to value finishing this course over actually learning the material. Many courses will give you points or badges or gold stars along the way, culminating into the final checkbox where you can say "I did it! I'm now a certified XYZ". There's nothing inherently wrong with that approach, it's just simply not the approach we are taking here. We want to take away any potential excuses or distractions from you learning the material. Scrolling through a lesson and submitting your homework half-assed to get a check-mark has the *potential* to do that, so we don't have check marks or badges. The curriculum is simply a guideline for the instructors to follow. Our instructors are trained in how to help you learn best, and have free reign to alter the course to fit your needs. Perhaps the rest of your cohort is moving quickly and you're stuck on a certain concept. Your instructor will work with you to help you in the way that suits you best. Their primary goal is to help you learn the foundations of programming, not to simply move as many students as possible through the funnel.

We are hoping this philosophy is self-selecting. If you are actually not interested in learning the foundations of programming, and just want the certificate, then the above description probably doesn't sound too appealing to you. 

## Phase 1 - Learning the basics
This is going to be learning the basics of programming, learning to get comfortable with the tools. Each week will have different homework assignments, and you'll submit the homework to the GitHub repository (don't worry if you don't know what that is).

## Phase 2 - The project
This is where you begin to start working on a project that builds on itself each week. You'll take the skills you learn from phase #1 and attempt to translate it to a project. Here is where we will begin to refine your skills and teach you how to use the tools in your toolbelt effectively. We'll review your code more strictly here, which will help you become a better programmer.

## [Under construction] Course Structure
### Weekly Lessons and Homework
Each week is a different lesson, which is supposed to be self-guiding. Work through the weekly lesson on your own, and then attempt the homework. The homework is designed to be challenging, it's designed to introduce you to concepts that you may not have encountered from the lessons. **Google is your friend here.** Professional software developers do *a lot* of googling, best to get good at it now. If you get stuck, or don't know where to start, let your instructor know. They can steer you in the right direction, tell you which things to search for, etc. Once you are finished with your homework, submit your work in a pull request (we go over this early in the course, don't worry if you don't know what that is).

This is not like most online courses, because it's not purely self-guided. It's highly interactive, and is supposed to give you a richer experience than following a handful of tutorials online. If you don't take advantage of your instructor (asking questions, attending office hours, etc.), you might as well go to YouTube and start watching lectures, or following tutorials online.

### Weekly Instructor Office Hours
Because this course is designed to expose you to many different concepts at a fast pace, you are likely going to have LOTS of questions. Office hours are *your time*, take advantage of them. Every week, your instructor will have set "office hours" where you can join the conference call and ask questions. This could be about the homework, it could be a concept, or about anything programming related. You are placed into a cohort based on your schedule availability, and matched with an instructor that has that availability. So you should be able to consistently attend office hours. Of course, things come up and you might miss a week or two here and there, but making office hours part of your weekly schedule is very important to your success in learning the material.

### 1-on-1 Instructor Sessions
Your cohort is based on schedule preferences, so your instructor's office hours will be at a time that works for you. However, sometimes life happens and you can't make it, then you have the option for a 1-on-1 session. You can request a 1-on-1 session with your instructor and work out scheduling together.

## FAQ
### Do you offer any sort of certificate or degree?
No, blah blah
### What is the course cost?
TBD
### Is this a coding bootcamp?
### Do you have any sort of job offer guarantee?
Nope :) Our goal is to help you learn the foundations of programming, and give you a solid platform to build off of as you continue learning after this course. Our goal is not to give you a fast track to being a "Full Stack Web Dev" or "Javscript Guru". We want you to understand the foundations of programming and have exposure to many software concepts. Hopefully you will be at a place where you could be an entry level developer, but that is not a guarantee that we make.

### Why should I do this over other online courses?
When starting to learn software, a common cycle to go through is:
- "Drinking from the fire hose" - learning a lot but being overwhelmed by it all and not knowing how it applies to anything worthwhile. Here you have an accurate view of how much you know, because you know almost nothing and you are aware of it.
- "Expert beginner" - you've come a long way, and fairly quickly. So you get cocky and think you are extra talented and believe that you probably know more than the old crotchety programmers who are "stuck in their ways". You have strong opinions, but if someone asked you to defend those opinions, you would falter and not be able to explain yourself well. At this point, you are over confident and think you know *more* than you actually do. 
- "First slice of humble pie" - Someone / something throws a wrench in your utopian view of the software world. Maybe it's your first time realizing that software only has value if it serves a business purpose. Maybe you were really confident about a certain design but it failed miserably. Maybe you get a nasty code review on code you thought was well written. You start to think, "Wow, maybe I don't know anything about software at all". You're brought back down to earth, and you think you know *less* than you actually do.
- "Learning with a healthy dose of humility" - you are still learning new things, but maybe not at such a rapid pace. You're slowly building your confidence back. You start forming opinions that you can defend. You know the tradeoffs of your designs. But there are always lots of unknown unknowns, and you're ok with that. At this point, you are slowly having getting back to the more accurate view of your skills and knowledge. 

Our goal here is to help minimize the time in the middle 2 phases. Doing things with a purely self-taught model has a higher risk at staying in the "Expert beginner" phase. You aren't having your code reviewed and you think you know a lot so you don't seek learning as aggressively as you once did. We want you to leave this course with a mature view of what learning software looks like. You're not going to finish this course and be an expert developer. You might not even be at a point where you could be an entry level developer. But our goal is for you to be aware of your current state as a developer, and to have a pretty clear idea of what it would take to reach your goals. We want you to leave this course with a healthy platform for continuing your learning, whether that's at an internship, an entry level developer position, on your own projects, or whatever. 

Now, for the actual answer - we believe that this class will bring more value than other online courses because of it's highly interactive nature. You are constantly getting feedback from your instructor(s). You are being told where your strengths and weaknesses are as a developer. You have the opportunity to ask deep questions from industry experts where googling may not be sufficient. Your instructor will help the "unknown unknowns" become "known unknowns", or even "known knowns" wherever possible. Most online courses are not like this. There are also many out there that are free and quite good. Your choice. It's a tradeoff, just like everything in software.
